            <p>Really, you're gonna pull that move? I guided your entire civilisation. Your people have a holiday named
                ricksgiving. They teach kids about me in school. It's called carpe diem Morty. Look it up. Oh boy, so
                you actually learned something today? What is this? Full House? I was living in the moment all day, and
                it kept getting me killed by Nazis. I think you need to think ahead and live in the moment. It's not
                like we can do this every week, we get 3 or 4 more of these tops.</p>

            <p>I was just killing some snaked up here like everyone else, I guess, and finishing the Christmas lights. I
                turned myself into a pickle, Morty! Boom! Big reveal! I'm a pickle! What do you think about that? I
                turned myself into a pickle! W-what are you just staring at me for, bro? I turned myself into a pickle,
                Morty. Awwww thanks, bitch! I'd like to order one large sofa chair with extra chair please. high chair,
                no no no recliner... and wheelchair on half.</p>

            <p>If I've learned one thing, it's that before you get anywhere in life, you gotta stop listening to
                yourself. 25 shmeckles? I-I-I-I don't even know what that- what is that? Is that a lot? Merchandise
                Morty, your only purpose in life is to buy & consume merchandise and you did it, you went into a store
                an actual honest to god store and you bought something, you didn't ask questions or raise ethical
                complaints you just looked into the bleeding jaws of capitalism and said 'yes daddy please' and I'm so
                proud of you, I only wish you could have bought more, I love buying things so much Morty. Hey listen,
                you know, if we're all bored over here, wouldn't the common denominator be you?</p>
